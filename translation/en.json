My drawing style consists of simple character designs with attractive colorful illustrations. Kologen is my OC, which you see on the home page and my logo!<br><br>I regularly sketch on my sketchbook during my free-time at my major. Please enjoy what I got to offer on my little art gallery.

    "desc": "I began making games from a long-time game design passion. Earliest of it was with the Geometry Dash level editor, experimenting with triggers and creating simple minigames. Later on, I moved to the Godot game engine, where I began self-learning game development principles which exposed me to multiple creative disciplines, making art (assets), animation, game logic, and codebases.<br><br>Over time, I began explored other tools to make games, such as the p5.js creative coding library, which allowed me to implement math to create game logic, collisions, and rapid prototypes. Hope you enjoy what I have here.",
